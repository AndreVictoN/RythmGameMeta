# RythmReaper
Rythm Reaper is a game made in Unity for the 33rd META (Mostra Específica de Trabalhos e Aplicações or Specific Exhibition of Works and Applications) from CEFET-MG (Centro Federal de Educação Tecnológica de Minas Gerais or Federal Center of Technological Education of Minas Gerais).

This work describes the use of the Unity platform for the development of a rythm game, highlighting it's tools and usefulness in the process. The objective was to explore the functionalities of Unity through the development of a rhythm game, allowing the synchronization of visual elements with musical beats. The methodology included a study of free Unity tools and libraries, such as DoTween, TextMeshPro and Cinemachine, in addition to analyses of games such as Friday Night Funkin and Muse Dash to identify characteristics of the genre. The development occurred gradually, using laboratories at CEFET Contagem and personal computers to implement and test the prototype. An initial menu, levels with music and animations, a points and lives system, and end-of-game screens were created. The results demonstrated the efficiency of the tools used and the ability to synchronize audio with visual elements, evidenced by the functionality of the playable prototype. It was concluded that Unity is effective for the development of rhythm games, providing simplified integration of resources. The project highlighted the relevance of mastering libraries and programming in C#, consolidating fundamental technical skills for the development of digital games.
